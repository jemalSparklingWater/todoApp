Things we know:
    map() => loops through an array and does some logic 
    filter() => loops through an array and returns a filtered array
        useful for when we want to get rid of something 

    inputText - the text entered into inputfield and then passed to todos array
    todos - array containing 'objects' {} - one for each todo 
        three properties - text, completed, id 

    
    set functions are used to update inputText and todos 


- Last thing we did - Added deleteHandler for todo component 


HomeWork: (Old)
    Add a complete handler for todo component 
        think about how to update todos array
        which property of the todo needs to change when complete is clicked
        where to add this handler function in todo component 

Homework: Lastest
    - Right now we can add a empty todo to our list
        - Write logic to prevent this 
    - Will email exercise on '?' / map / filter
